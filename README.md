# Tax Evaders - student workers website
### By Jenny and Ananya
> Tax Evaders is a map application (mapplication) website where student workers at UCLA can share their stories about how working at UCLA has affected their lives, and the mapping tool displays their workplace and their stories. Through this website, we hope to create a community where student workers feel comfortable sharing their narratives and feel empowered by others in a similar situation.

### What social problem is being addressed?
    
We are looking at student workers at UCLA and how their jobs affect them. Working at a job while also having time to focus on academics, extracurriculars, professional development, social time, and more is something that many students at UCLA struggle with, but because talking about financials is such a taboo subjext in today's society, student workers may not feel comfortable discussing these issues. Therefore, we wanted to create a website where student workers feel comfortable sharing their narratives on how working has impacted them, and to create a community of student workers in similar situations. 
    

### Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
    
The empowered community in our mapplication is student workers at UCLA. A large percentage of UCLA students work jobs, either on- or off-campus, to help cover the costs of attending this school, but because discussing finances is frowned upon in today's society, they do not have a space to feel comfortable airing their grievances and struggles because of their jobs. So, we wanted to create this mapplication to empower student workers and allow them to share their stories. The website will empower UCLA student workers through creating a community where students know they are not on their own, as well as create somewhat of a forum (the map pop-ups) for students to share their stories/air their grievances. Moreover, it serves as a database/library for all of these students' experiences which can ultimately be collected and used to advocate to the UCLA administration to improve student worker packages.


## What technology was used in this project?

We use open source software including Leaflet and Papaparse as well as HTML, Javascript, and CSS and in order to create our webpage. We also use Google surveys to collect our data and google sheets to view our collected data and link it into our HTML code.

   ### What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
    
  There may be ethical problems in developing this tool because we are going to collect some information on students' financial situations, but to combat     this potential issue we will keep our survey 100% anonymous and allow people to delete their responses if they feel any such need to.

## How can this project be used in the future?

In the long term, we hope to see this tool being utilized to foster community building within the UCLA student worker community. Specifically, we hope that student organizing groups such as student worker unions can use this information to supplement their activism and fight for better benefits for student workers, as well as higher compensation packages for graduate students. We also hope that this tool could empower students and promote community building through increasing the accessibility of this usually-taboo information, and help students learn more about how others in their same situation feel and know that they are not alone in their situation. Our tool would hopefully decrease the stigma around talking about personal finances and struggle, and create a more understanding and welcoming community which is more accommodating to those with financial struggles. Students are often pressured to work part-time jobs to relieve their familyâ€™s financial burden, which causes stress and takes away time from them for studies and social life, so we hope our tool can be utilized to fight for more financial aid/grant offers.

##The Mapplication
### Features
1. **The map**

Our interactive map shows popups for where each student works, and when you click on the marker a popup including where they work, their degree pathway, and where they are from shows up. The map itself is centered around UCLA, as the majority of the students work in or around campus. When you click on the different markers, the map will zoom in on each location.

2. **Slideshow**

Our interactive slideshow clicks through each marker on the map, and gives the full story of each student worker. 

3. **Menu Bar**

At the top of our website, there is a menu bar which allows access to the home page (where our map is), a page to learn more about the creators, a large button link to our survey, and a button that opens a popup which explains more about our project.

4. **Descriptions**

Underneath our map and slideshow, there are descriptions to the project and UCLA Zero Waste. Along with these descriptions, there are links to find out more about both topics.

5. **About the CreatorsPage**

The About the Creators page allows users to learn more about the creators of the website, including why we chose to create this website and a little bit about our backgrounds. Users can also find our contact information on this page.
