# Tax Evaders! Rough Draft
Jenny and Ananya



  ## What social problem is being addressed?
    
We are looking at inequality and how certain tax distributions exacerbate inequality and only are really helping the rich. We know that lower-middle class Americans lose a lot of their purchasing power through taxes. We know that obviously the tax laws are written and influenced by the wealthy and so we want to see how much money people are paying in taxes compared to their individual incomes. 
    
   ## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
    
This could be a good source of community-based information to share with those who might not be too educated on the topic, as well as raise awareness of the subject to anyone who is a taxpayer. Overall, we think that if people are able to compare how much money they are paying in taxes to others, there would be more transparency and it would be harder for wealthy people to get away with writeoffs/tax evasion and fraud. 

   ## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
    
If we're collecting community data there may be an ethical issue, as there is a stigma around talking about salaries as well as it could seem rude or invasive to ask students this question. With regards to technical issues, it may be difficult to draw the lines around certain districts (like, we wouldn't know where to cut off/draw the lines) and find the average income of the area. 

  ## What technology was used in this project?
We use open source software including Leaflet and Papaparse as well as HTML, Javascript, and CSS and in order to create our webpage. We also use Google surveys to collect our data and google sheets to view our collected data and link it into our HTML code. 
  ## How can this project be used in the future?
 In the long term, we hope to see this tool being utilized to foster community building within the UCLA student worker community. Specifically, we hope that student organizing groups such as student worker unions can use this information to supplement their activism and fight for better benefits for student workers, as well as higher compensation packages for graduate students. We also hope that this tool could empower students and promote community building through increasing the accessibility of this usually-taboo information, and help students learn more about how others in their same situation feel and know that they are not alone in their situation. Our tool would hopefully decrease the stigma around talking about personal finances and struggle, and create a more understanding and welcoming community which is more accommodating to those with financial struggles. Students are often pressured to work part-time jobs to relieve their family’s financial burden, which causes stress and takes away time from them for studies and social life, so we hope our tool can be utilized to fight for more financial aid/grant offers.
 
  ### Who is the project for and why is it important?
 Our project is directed towards student workers at UCLA and a tool for students to share their stories and struggles that are caused by needing to work on campus. This tool would be utilized by anyone in Westwood who wants to learn more about the impact of taxes on the quality of life for student workers and their families, as well as how students feel about a portion of their paychecks being taken by the government to fund projects that they may not agree with. Moreover, it can be used to build a sense of community as paychecks and money are a sensitive subject and the anonymous factor of this website could foster a sense of community and let students who are struggling know that they are not alone with their financial struggles. 

  ### How does the website empower people?
 The website will empower UCLA student workers through creating a community where students know they are not on their own, as well as create somewhat of a forum (the map pop-ups) for students to share their stories/air their grievances. Moreover, it serves as a database/library for all of these students' experiences which can ultimately be collected and used to advocate to the UCLA administration to improve student worker packages.
 
  ### What changes you would like to focus on between now and the final? Why?
We would definitely like to fix up the formatting of our actual website since it's a bit wonky right now. We are also thinking about adding some more questions that are multiple choice/yes-no questions to our survey so we can have more graphs/charts to summarize the data rather than just having qualitative/personal responses since also charts and graphs are a bit more anonymous/does not place as large of a spotlight on certain people's responses. We also need to edit our survey to remove any responses that say they are not comfortable with sharing their story.
