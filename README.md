  ## What social problem is being addressed?
    
We are looking at inequality and how certain tax distributions exacerbate inequality and only are really helping the rich. We know that lower-middle class Americans lose a lot of their purchasing power through taxes. We know that obviously the tax laws are written and influenced by the wealthy and so we want to see how much money people are paying in taxes compared to their individual incomes. 
    
   ## Who is being empowered by your mapplication?
    
This could be a good source of community-based information to share with those who might not be too educated on the topic, as well as raise awareness of the subject to anyone who is a taxpayer. Overall, we think that if people are able to compare how much money they are paying in taxes to others, there would be more transparency and it would be harder for wealthy people to get away with writeoffs/tax evasion and fraud. 

   ## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?
    
If we're collecting community data there may be an ethical issue, as there is a stigma around talking about salaries as well as it could seem rude or invasive to ask students this question. With regards to technical issues, it may be difficult to draw the lines around certain districts (like, we wouldn't know where to cut off/draw the lines) and find the average income of the area.
